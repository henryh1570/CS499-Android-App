Sleep App (Name subject to change)
==================================

This is an android app developed in CS499 Spring 2017. The purpose of this app is to 
help people with a similar issue to mine; I have difficulty sleeping at a healthy time. 

The main issue that I have is that I lose sleep due to night activities that I feel compelled to complete before resting. 
I cannot sleep if I do not feel acomplished/satisfied with the progress made during the day/night. 
With this app, I hope to help other users and myself let go of responsibilities and feelings of unsatisfactory. 
This may be done in several ways, such as providing statistical data about sleep and providing conclusions and reports of
 the possible benefits from ending the day earlier to put off the night work for the next day.
